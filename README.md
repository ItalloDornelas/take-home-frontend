# Frontend Project with Next.js 15 (App Router) and TypeScript

This project is a modern frontend application built using **Next.js 15** with the **App Router** and **TypeScript**. It takes advantage of the latest improvements in Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes, providing a robust and efficient developer experience.

## Features
- **Next.js 15**: Leverage the latest updates and performance enhancements.
- **App Router**: Folder-based routing for intuitive and scalable navigation.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development with static type checking.
- **Modular Structure**: Clean and maintainable code organization.
- **Edge-Ready**: Optimized for serverless and edge environments.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

Additionally, you need to provide an `.env` file with the following variable:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<your_api_url>
```
This environment variable is used to configure the base URL for API calls in the application.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create the `.env` File
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the required environment variable:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<your_api_url>
```

### 4. Run the Development Server
Start the development server with the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Build for Production
Generate the production build using:
```bash
npm run build
```
To preview the production build:
```bash
npm run start
```

## Project Structure
```

├── app/            # Next.js App Router (handles routing)
│   ├── api/       # API routes (serverless functions)
│   ├── (routes)/ # Application routes
│   └── layout.tsx # Root layout
├── components/    # Reusable UI components
├── public/        # Static assets

```

## Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the project for production.
- `npm run start`: Start the production server.
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint to lint the code.
- `npm run type-check`: Run TypeScript type checking.

## Routing with the App Router
- **Folder-based Routing**: The `app/` directory uses folders to define routes.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Create dynamic routes using square brackets, e.g., `app/(routes)/[id]/page.tsx`.
- **Layouts**: Share layouts across pages using `layout.tsx`.
- **Loading States**: Add loading indicators with `loading.tsx`.
- **Error Boundaries**: Handle errors gracefully with `error.tsx`.

## Deployment
To deploy the application, follow these steps:
1. Build the project using `npm run build`.
2. Deploy the `.next` folder to your hosting provider. Popular options include:
   - **Vercel**: The creators of Next.js, offering seamless deployment.
   - **Netlify**: Excellent for static and server-side apps.
   - **AWS Amplify**: Scalable hosting solution.

## Notes
- Use `app/api/` for serverless functions to handle backend logic.
- Static assets like images and fonts should be placed in the `public/` directory.
- Utilize new performance optimizations introduced in Next.js 15 for faster builds and runtime performance.
